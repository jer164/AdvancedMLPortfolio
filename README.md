## Jackson Rudoff's Advanced ML Portfolio

This repo serves as a portfolio of my work for QMSS 5074: Advanced Projects in Machine Learning. 

#### Key Files

Contained in the top directory is a write-up on my three projects, describing my tuning processes, results, and other takeaways from completing these projects. 

Each subfolder contains the write-ups for my prior projects. These notebooks have more detailed and structured descriptions of my experimentation with models for a given challenge, and my conclusions regarding the project overall.
